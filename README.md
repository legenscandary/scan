# Legenscandary

An automatic scan server software for scanners with document feeder.
It creates multi-page PDFs with selectable text (OCR) by just one button press.

## Simple Use

1. A stack of documents is processed after pressing the button on the scanner.
2. Front and back of each sheet of paper is scanned and stored in a PDF file.
3. OCR is employed to make the text searchable & selectable in the PDF.
4. Empty pages are detected and removed during the process.
5. Each resulting PDF file is named after the first date found in the document
 along with the first few word encountered. 
6. All generated PDF files and the scanned images are made easily accessible
in the local network on a samba share (Windows network share).

## Advanced Use

Special command sheets allow to switch between different modes of operation:

- By default each sheet of paper is scanned to a single PDF file
 consisting of 2 pages maximum (*single mode*).
- A special command sheet allows to switch to *multi mode*:
 A single PDF is created from all sheets which follow that command sheet.
- When another command sheet is encountered, a new PDF file is created
to contain the next sequence of pages.

## Supported Scanners

- Fujitsu ScanSnap iX500

Currently, Legenscandary was developed and tested with the Fujitsu ScanSnap.
Other devices may work too, they have to support double-sided scanning in a single pass.
For control, the respective device as to be supported by SANE on Linux.
This can be tested by running the command `scanimage -L`.
If the scanner is listed, chances are good that it can be supported by Legenscandary.

Please open a feature request in the *issues* section for each desired scanner.
